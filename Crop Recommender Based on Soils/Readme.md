 Here is a draft README for the crop recommendation code:

# Crop Recommendation System

This project builds a model to recommend which crop to grow based on soil properties and climate conditions.

## Data Processing

The data is loaded from the Crop_recommendation.csv file. The columns with all missing values and containing "Unnamed" are removed.

## EDA 

- Explore number of unique crops (multi-class target variable)
- Check for missing values
- Split data into training and test sets

## Feature Analysis

- Train a separate LogisticRegression model for each feature and evaluate performance using F1-score 
- Identify most important features: potassium, humidity and rainfall
- Plot correlation heatmap 

## Model Building 

- Train a LogisticRegression model using the selected features 
- Multi-class classification handled using multinomial option
- Evaluate model performance using weighted F1-score

## Conclusion

The model achieves a weighted F1-score of 0.86 on test data. The most informative features are identified. 

## Future Work

Hyperparameter tuning can further improve performance. Other models like Random Forest Classifier can also be tried out for this multi-class prediction problem.
